## **Step 1: Learning the essentials of Frenchtoast**

The first part in this step is picking the right type of bread.
The most common options are sliced  white bread or wheat bread. 
Although the fluffier the bread the better! Like a fresh loaf of Brioche.
You can even try other styles of bread. Like potatoe bread or cinnamon swirl. 
There are many great options to choose from at your local bakery, unless you wish to bake the bread yourself.

Before you begin cooking cooking you will want to prepare your cooking station.

You will need a pan the size of one slice of bread or larger.

You will also need a plate to dip your toast in a mixture of egg and milk or milk substitute. You can use 2 eggs for every 1 cup of milk as a good ratio.

Now! Heat your pan add a generous amount of oil or butter to the pan. Enough for there to be a thin layer covering the bottom. 

Dip the bread in the egg milk mixture.
Make sure to flip and dip both sides. 

Then cook in the pan and flip until golden brown on both sides 

No one likes soggy french toast.

Then move the Frenchtoast to a clean plate once its cooked.

## **Step 3: Plating and elevating the dining experience**
   
After you plate your Frenchtoast

There is a whole world of options to choose for your toppings

From cheese and whip cream, to jams or jelly, powdered or brown sugar, chopped fruits, even Ice cream 

Anything is possible.
